[QEYnet](qeynet.com) is a startup company aiming to deploy a quantum key distribution system using satellites ... **_add more here plz_**

## Description about the project

Astra will be a local, GUI-based program that will allow QEYnet employees and customers to read and interact with data from QEYnet satellites and other devices.

Satellites out of view are critical to QEYnet’s mission, hence they need some form of software that allows them and customers to monitor the state of their satellites at all times.

Our application will give employees a convenient and smooth GUI to check satellite data and keep them informed on satellite health through the use of notifications.

## Key Features

* **Read in custom telemetry files**

The user can upload a local file from their computer and have the information accessible to the program. If there are problems with the file, the upload does not go through and the user is shown an error.

* **Check the current status/operating mode of QRx/satellite**

In just a few clicks, the user can see every major piece of broad information about a satellite. The information is correct and up-to-date relative to the data known to the program.

* **Plot selected variables against time**

Data from telemetry frames is plotted on a graph with time as the independent variable and user-chosen dependent variables. The user can customize what specific data is plotted, along with the general appearance of the resulting graph.

* **View data for a chosen telemetry frame**

The program keeps track of a number of telemetry frames that the user can select between. Doing so displays all data linked to the chosen telemetry frame, along with descriptions of the data.

* **Apply filters to data**

Upon specifying a criterion, only telemetry frames (if viewing frames) / data points (if viewing a graph) that satisfy the criterion are displayed. The table for the current frame can be reduced to chosen columns and sorted according to how the user desires. The filter can be cleared through a GUI button.

* **Display warning messages**

When unexpected behaviours happen, warnings will be displayed on the dashboard, ordered by priority. For sufficiently critical problems, additional methods of notifying staff will be deployed such as popups or emails (if time permits).

## Instructions
 * Clear instructions for how to use the application from the end-user's perspective
 * How do you access it? For example: Are accounts pre-created or does a user register? Where do you start? etc. 
 * Provide clear steps for using each feature described in the previous section.
 * This section is critical to testing your application and must be done carefully and thoughtfully.

 ## Development requirements
 * What are the technical requirements for a developer to set up on their machine or server (e.g. OS, libraries, etc.)?
 * Briefly describe instructions for setting up and running the application. You should address this part like how one would expect a README doc of real-world deployed application would be.
 * You can see this [example](https://github.com/alichtman/shallow-backup#readme) to get started.

 ## Deployment and Github Workflow
​
Describe your Git/GitHub workflow. Essentially, we want to understand how your team members share codebase, avoid conflicts and deploys the application.
​
 * Be concise, yet precise. For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Describe your overall deployment process from writing code to viewing a live application
 * What deployment tool(s) are you using? And how?
 * Don't forget to **briefly justify why** you chose this workflow or particular aspects of it!

 ## Coding Standards and Guidelines
 Keep this section brief, a maximum of 2-3 lines. You would want to read through this [article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/coding-standards-and-guidelines/) to get more context about what this section is for before attempting to answer.
  * These are 2 optional resources that you might want to go through: [article with High level explanation](https://blog.codacy.com/coding-standards-what-are-they-and-why-do-you-need-them/) and [this article with Detailed Explanation](https://google.github.io/styleguide/)

 ## Licenses 
​
 Keep this section as brief as possible. You may read this [Github article](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository) for a start.
​
 * What type of license will you apply to your codebase? And why?
 * What affect does it have on the development and use of your codebase?
