## Iteration 3 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: 2023-11-09
 * Where: Online

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. What worked well

 * The team has done a relatively good job with coordination,
both within and between the subteams established in D2.
Decisions that would have an impact on another subteam's work were communicated,
as were issues in the code of other subteams.
Generally speaking, the team was kept updated on the status of each subteam's work.
Communication within subteams happened often,
allowing each person in the subteam to have a sense of what the other person was doing.
 * The way that communication was set up heavily facilitated the above.
We had a Discord server, with a channel for general communication, three subteam-specific channels,
and a channel for communicating with our partner.
Team members could coordinate within subteams on the dedicated channel for the subteam
and between subteams by asking questions or raising problems in other subteams' channels.
Over the coding portion of D3, we largely stuck to asynchronous communication through text rather than meetings,
which meant fewer headaches with scheduling and a more permanent record of certain decisions.
This asynchronous style of communication extended to communication with our partner --
we started asking for more clarifications outside of meetings,
allowing us to get started sooner on work that depended on those clarifications.


#### Q2. What did not work well

 * Time management and working with deadlines continue to be an issue for us.
We still have a tendency to complete tasks behind schedule,
which gives less time to complete further tasks up ahead,
and ultimately leads to not-previously-anticipated cuts in scope for releases.
 * One particular effect of the time constraints was a loss of organization.
Instead of using pull requests and code reviews, we oftentimes pushed our changes directly to a branch
that other subteams would directly pull or create a new branch from for their own work.
Branches were used in a more haphazard way than was optimal.
Although this approach did allow rapid iteration and coordination,
it also meant less control over the quality of the code.


#### Q3(a). Planned changes

 * Take plans and timelines more seriously,
and do a better job holding ourselves and each other accountable for meeting internal deadlines.
 * Assuming no time constraints, switch to a more structured workflow,
using branches and pull requests more often and more effectively.


#### Q3(b). Integration & Next steps

For integration, we simply merged all the work from the three subteams into the same branch,
and made changes as needed to accommodate each other's code.
Decisions regarding the interfaces between teams were generally communicated in advance,
so there generally wasn't much pain with the integration process.
The main work of D3 for us was really writing new code to cover features
that were not covered in our minimal-scope D2.


## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?

 * We did not make any specific preparations for the demo --
we simply used the finished code from our working branch without worrying about deployment.
We demoed one of the two screens that we were planning to finish for D3: the telemetry tab.
(The other screen, the alarm tab, was not yet ready to be demoed.)
Our partner was generally satisfied with the work we had so far, and offered some feedback on the UI.
The demo occurred two days behind schedule,
and one subteam required the support of other subteams to complete their part,
contributing to the feelings regarding time management and accountability discussed before.
